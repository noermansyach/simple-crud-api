# Simple CRUD with Spring Boot and Java 17 (Using ArrayList as Dummy Data)

## Project Description

This project is a simple **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using **Spring Boot** and **Java 17**. The application does not use an external database but instead utilizes an `ArrayList` as a temporary data storage. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to implement basic CRUD operations with Spring Boot, while focusing on learning the core principles of Spring Boot, such as controllers, services, and routing, without depending on a database.

## Objectives

- Create a simple web application using **Spring Boot** to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Use an **ArrayList** as the data storage for simplicity, simulating data persistence without a database.
- Learn how to implement the fundamental concepts of **Spring Boot** such as controllers, services, and models.
- Understand how to manage HTTP requests and perform basic error handling.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**: The latest LTS version of Java, used to write the application.
- **Spring Boot 2.x**: A Java framework used for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Maven/Gradle**: Build automation tools for managing dependencies and building the application.
- **Spring Web**: A Spring module that provides functionality to build web applications and handle HTTP requests.
- **Postman/Insomnia**: API testing tools for testing the applicationâ€™s RESTful endpoints.
